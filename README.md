<h1 align="center">✅ Add Eslint and Prettier to Svelte</h1>

## ❓ What is this?
This is an **experimental** command to add liniting to your SvelteKit project.

## 🛠 Usage
You must start with a fresh copy of the official SvelteKit template, which is currently created by running this command:
```sh
npm init svelte@next
```

Once that is set up, run this command in your project directory to set up Bulma:
```sh
npx svelte-add manuel3108/svelte-add-linting
```

After the preset runs,
* You may need to restart / reload your IDE, in order for the `.editorconfig` to take effect.

* You can `npm run lint`, to lint all your files and check the formatting of them.

* You can `npm run format`, to format all your files.

_**Note: Other scripts where added, but they are only implementation details and are not intendet to be used manually!**_
